#ASLAB ATTACK
---
AslabAttack is a retro arcade shooter that combines classic Space Invaders gameplay with modern pixel art aesthetics. Set against a gorgeous cosmic backdrop, players control a lone defender at the bottom of the screen, shooting upward at descending waves of alien bugs. Simple to learn but challenging to master, the game features increasing difficulty, multiple enemy types, and competitive leaderboards.

**101 Guide to Play!**
**Objective: Survive as long as possible and eliminate alien swarms to achieve the highest score.**
1. **Movement & Combat:** Use the controls to navigate the ship, dodge incoming enemies, and fire projectiles to destroy them.
2. **Health System:** The player starts with 3 hearts (life bar). The game ends when all lives are lost due to collisions or enemy fire.
3. **Upgrades:** Collect power-ups to increase the "rocket lethal capacity" and unlock new weapon behaviors.
4. **Weapon Switching:** Thanks to the Strategy Pattern, players can dynamically switch between different attack modes, such as single laser or spread shots.

Play it with happy mind, coquette pink spaceship, DEFEAT THE FINAL BOSS!
